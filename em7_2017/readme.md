1. The EM7 2017 is the one with Ergonic Keyboard 2017 carved on the back of the keyboard whose PCB is yellow color. The EM7 R1 has weight with black PCB.

2. First thing first, the PCB of 2017 version has weird designs: the 'b' key and 'space' key. which means these two 'b' keys and 'space' keys cannot be set into diffent usages.

3. To use:
the keyboard will be set as storage device in the first time of use. copy the EM7 firmware into the USB storage and rename it as 'firmware.bin'. restart, and you can set the keymap now.
